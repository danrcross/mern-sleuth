# MERN-SLEUTH: Google Books Search Engine

## [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This simple website uses the MERN stack: a MongoDB database, a React front end, and a Node.js/Express.js server/API.

It is a website which allows users to search for books via the Google Books API. If a user signs up and logs in, they can save books. The saved books are stored in persistent storage, in the back end, associated with their username.

To create this application, I was given a starter code: a fully functional version of the app that used a RESTful API. My task was to refactor the RESTful API, converting it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

The application was built/deployed using Render.
